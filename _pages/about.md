- I am a second-year MS student in [College of Computer Science](https://cs.bjut.edu.cn/) at [Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Junzhong Ji](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/info/1332/4973.htm) and [Prof. Xiaodan Zhang](https://zhangxiaodan-bjut.github.io/). I received my B.Eng in [School of Computer and Information](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/) from [Hefei University of Technology (HFUT)](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) in 2023.

📌 My research interests lie in Unified multimodal large model(Uni-MLLMs) and Medical multimodal large models (Med-MLLMs).

✉️ Welcome to contact me for any discussion and cooperation!

💥 💥 **I will graduate in 2026 and am currently seeking opportunities for PhD studies and research internships.  If you are interested, please feel free to contact me** 💥 💥
